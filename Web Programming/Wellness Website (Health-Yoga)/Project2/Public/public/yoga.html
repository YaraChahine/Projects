            <p>The beauty of yoga is that you don’t have to be a yogi or yogini to reap the benefits. Whether you are
                young or old, overweight or fit, yoga has the power to calm the mind and strengthen the body. Don’t be
                intimidated by yoga terminology, fancy yoga studios and complicated poses. Yoga is for everyone.

        <h2> 10 Yoga Poses You Need to Know</h2>
    </div>
    <p class="yoga-poses">These 10 poses are a complete yoga workout. Move slowly through each pose, remembering to
        breathe as you move.
        Pause after any pose you find challenging, especially if you are short of breath, and start again when your
        breathing returns to normal. The idea is to hold each pose for a few, slow breaths before moving on to the next
        one.</p>
