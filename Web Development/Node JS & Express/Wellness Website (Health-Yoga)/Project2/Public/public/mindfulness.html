                        Mindfulness is the basic human ability to be fully present, aware of where we are and what we’re
                        doing,
                        and not overly reactive or overwhelmed by what’s going on around us.
                        <br><br>
                        While mindfulness is something we all naturally possess, it’s more readily available to us when
                        we
                        practice on a daily basis.
                        <br><br>
                        Whenever you bring awareness to what you’re directly experiencing via your senses, or to your
                        state of
                        mind via your thoughts and emotions, you’re being mindful. And there’s growing research showing
                        that
                        when you train your brain to be mindful, you’re actually remodeling the physical structure of
                        your
                        brain.

                <h2> The Basics of Mindfulness Practice</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><span class="first">Set aside some time.</span> You don’t need a meditation cushion or bench, or
                        any
                        sort of special equipment to access your
                        mindfulness skills—but you do need to set aside some time and space.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><span class="first">Observe the present moment as it is.</span> The aim of mindfulness is not
                        quieting
                        the mind, or attempting to achieve a
                        state of eternal calm. The goal is simple: we’re aiming to pay attention to the present moment,
                        without
                        judgment.
                        Easier said than done, we know.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><span class="first">Let your judgments roll by.</span> When we notice judgments arise during our
                        practice, we can make a mental note of them,
                        and let them pass.</li>

                    <li><span class="first">Return to observing the present moment as it is.</span> Our minds often get
                        carried
                        away in thought. That’s why mindfulness
                        is the practice of returning, again and again, to the present moment.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><span class="first">Be kind to your wandering mind.</span> Don’t judge yourself for whatever
                        thoughts
                        crop up, just practice recognizing when
                        your mind has wandered off, and gently bring it back.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2> A Simple Meditation Practice</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><span class="first">Sit comfortably.</span> Find a spot that gives you a stable, solid,
                        comfortable
                        seat.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><span class="first">Notice what your legs are doing.</span> If on a cushion, cross your legs
                        comfortably
                        in
                        front of you. If on a chair, rest the bottoms of your feet on the floor..
                    </li><br>
                    <li><span class="first">Straighten your upper body—but don’t stiffen.</span>
                        Your spine has natural curvature. Let it be there.</li><br>
                    <li><span class="first">Notice what your arms are doing.</span> Situate your upper arms parallel to
                        your
                        upper
                        body. Rest the palms of your hands on your legs wherever it feels most natural.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><span class="first">
                            Soften your gaze.</span> Drop your chin a little and let your gaze fall gently downward.
                        It’s not
                        necessary
                        to close your eyes. You can simply let what appears before your eyes be there without focusing
                        on
                        it.</li><br>
                    <li><span class="first">Feel your breath.</span> Bring your attention to the physical sensation of
                        breathing: the
                        air moving through your nose or mouth, the rising and falling of your belly, or your chest.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><span class="first">Notice when your mind wanders from your breath.</span> Inevitably, your
                        attention
                        will
                        leave the breath and wander to other places. Don’t worry. There’s no need to block or eliminate
                        thinking. When you notice your mind wandering gently return your attention to the breath.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><span class="first">
                            Be kind about your wandering mind.</span> You may find your mind wandering constantly—that’s
                        normal,
                        too.
                        Instead of wrestling with your thoughts, practice observing them without reacting. Just sit and
                        pay
                        attention. As hard as it is to maintain, that’s all there is. Come back to your breath over and
                        over
                        again, without judgment or expectation.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><span class="first">When you’re ready, gently lift your gaze</span> (if your eyes are closed,
                        open
                        them). Take
                        a moment and notice any sounds in the environment. Notice how your body feels right now. Notice
                        your
                        thoughts and emotions.
                    </li><br>
